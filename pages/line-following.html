                            <h3>Line Following Competition</h3>
                            <h4>Competition Rules</h4>
                            <p>
                                The rules we will be using for this competition are the 
                                <a href="https://robothon.org/rules-line-following/">Line Following</a> and 
                                <a href="https://robothon.org/advanced-line-following/">Advanced Line Following</a>
                                Robothon rules by the 
                                <a href="http://www.seattlerobotics.org/">Seattle Robotics Society</a>.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Qualification Round</h4>
                            <p>
                                All competitors in the line following competition need to successfully complete
                                a qualification round before attempting the line following courses. The 
                                qualification course will be the line following track on a LEGO Mindstorms
                                Robotics Invention System Test Pad. The track is a 1'' black oval with straight
                                edges connected by 90&deg; curves.
                            </p>
                            <div>
                                <img id="test-pad" src="../images/test-pad.jpeg" 
                                    alt="LEGO Mindstorms RIS Test Pad.">
                            </div>
                            <p>
                                Each constestant will get three opportunities to successfully complete one 
                                circuit around the track. If the robot fails to navigate the course all three
                                times, the contestant will not be able to move on to the competition rounds.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The qualification round runs will not be timed or scored.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A seperate program can be used for the qualification round, if desired. Make sure
                                that the README file in the GitHub repository clearly identifies how the program
                                should be run (e.g., press the A button to run the qualification, press the B 
                                button to run the line following program, and press the C button to run the 
                                advanced line following program). The programs can also be individual
                                sketches to be uploaded for each round.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Competition Rounds</h4>
                            <p>
                                There will be two competition rounds: line following and advanced line following.
                                Each competitor will get two runs in each round. The best of the two runs 
                                will be used as the time for that round.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The competition courses will follow the design guidelines in the SRS Robothon
                                rules. The only variance is that the track surface will be 12'' &times; 48'' 
                                white melamine shelves placed together two or three shelves wide (24'' or 36''). 
                            </p>
                            <h4>GitHub Classroom</h4>
                            <p>
                                To submit your robot competition code, we will be using GitHub Classroom.
                                The classroom creates a private GitHub repository for each competitor. 
                            </p>
