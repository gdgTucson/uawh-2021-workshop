                                Note that, if you are using Windows, you also need to install Windows drivers by following the

                                <a href="https://www.pololu.com/docs/0J63/5.1">section 5.1 of the Pololu Zumo 32U4 Robot User's Guide</a>.

                            <h4>Hello World! (Blink)</h4>
                            <p>
                                A "Hello World!" program is a tradition in computer programming that was most 
                                likely started by 
                                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Kernighan">Brian Kernighan</a>,
                                the creator of the C programming language. It is usually the first program you 
                                write when learning a new programming language and is often used by experienced
                                programmers to ensure their development environment is set up properly.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We will continue that tradition for the Zumo robot. Follow the instructions in 
                                <a href="https://www.pololu.com/docs/0J63/5.2">section 5.2 of the Pololu Zumo 32U4 Robot User's Guide</a>.
                                to install the Blink sketch on your Zumo robot from the Basics folder of the 
                                Examples menu. You will not need to turn the power switch on for the robot, since
                                the USB cable will power the microcontroller board and that is all you will need
                                to blink the LED.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Is the yellow LED blinking on and off at a one second rate?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Congratulations! You've successfully installed and run your first sketch 
                                on the Zumo 32U4 robot.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Simple sumo robot starter program</h4>
                            <p>
                                A blinking LED is fun and all, but not very useful for a sumo robot 
                                competition. Let's install another example on the Zumo robot that 
                                will provide a solid foundation for your competitive sumo robot code.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Open up the examples menu in the Arduino IDE. This time, we are going
                                to choose the BorderDetect sketch. You will find this in the Zumo32U4
                                folder. (If you manually installed the Zumo library, this may have a 
                                different name &mdash; it will be whatever you named the library when
                                you installed it.)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This sketch is a very simple sumo program, but it has the basics you
                                need to start with. In terms of Rob Brooks' Subsumption Architecture, 
                                this would be the <emph>level 0</emph> behavior &mdash; the default
                                behavior for the robot when no other behavior is subsuming it.
                            </p>
                            <p>

                            <h4>Mini Sumo Rules</h4>
                            <p>
                                The rules we will be using for this competition are the 
                                <a href="https://robothon.org/rules-sumo/">Robothon Mini Sumo rules</a>

                            <h4>Double Elimination Bracket</h4>
                            <p>
                                The format for the mini sumo competition will be <emph>double elimination</emph>
                                as shown in the following bracket diagram for a four robot competition.
                            </p>
                            <div>
                                <img id="bracket" src="images/bracket.png" 
                                    alt="Bracket for a four robot double elimination competition.">
                            </div>
                            <p>
                                What this means is that a competitor is not eliminated until they have been 
                                defeated twice. This is a common format for mini sumo competitions because it 
                                means that, even if you have a mishap like a loose battery, you still have a 
                                chance to win the competition.
